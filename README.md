# A PHP Database Migration Tool

I liked the simplicity of the `php-database-migration` tool created by `alwex`.
I have forked the repository to add configuration changes that make
integration into existing products easier, as well as providing more
flexibility to developers.

## Planned Features
I am currently focusing on the following features:
* User defined directories
* Support for multiple databases with separate migrations
* Better handling of remote migrations without local

## Getting Started

This section will be added to once the vision for the package
is more complete.
